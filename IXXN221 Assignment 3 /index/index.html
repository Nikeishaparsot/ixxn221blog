    <h3> Week One 11.07</h3>

    <p>
        Today's class was the first of the semester, there was a brief 
        introduction to the course and its assignments. Within the assignments 
        it was said it would include coding for websites which I have not done 
        before, I did previously take Creative Coding in my first year, though I didn’t
        do too well in it, nor do I remember any information from that course.
        Given that, I will have to make sure I pay extra attention to that segment in the learning of this course so I can achieve what I want. I’m hoping to learn the basics for coding a  website so I can use it in the future as Web design is a path I'd be interested in taking after finishing university.

    <h3> Week Two 18.07</h3>   
    <p>The beginning of the lecture was particularly interesting as we dove into 
        the history behind web design and what it was like when it first appeared 
        in the world. I found it interesting that the name of Google was deliberately 
        a misspelling of the word googol meaning 10 to the power of 100. The introduction 
        of Assignment 1 was about user personas which I thought was an interesting concept 
        as a project especially because I wasn’t sure where it would lead in the next assignments.
        But as I started to develop my user persona I realised how important it is to empathise 
        with users when designing for a particular audience. It is most definitely a crucial 
        process that allows us to be user-centred in the design approach.

    <h3> Week Three 25.07</h3>
    <p>This week’s lecture included some history of web design from 1998 
        to 2008 but particularly it was the British student, Alex Tew’s Million 
        Dollar Home page launched in 2005 that really caught my eye during this 
        lecture. I thought it was such a cool concept that he created a place where 
        you could click on the brand's logo on this image and then it would take you 
        to their business. Although visually it is overwhelming, it is something I've 
        never seen or known existed. I also didn’t realise how important the aesthetics 
        and user experience can be in the online space but given that 79% of business-to-customer 
        users say that the user experience is as important as the company products/services,
        it is a significant contributing factor to the success of a website.

    <h3> Week Four 01.08</h3>
    <p>today's lecture was about the most recent development in web design starting 
        from 2009 and progressing to the present day. One thing I learned was that Adobe
        XD existed which I am now very intrigued to try. We also covered customer journey 
        maps and user flows and how they are used to understand the user. When I was creating 
        my customer journey map for my user persona Isabella, it made me feel more like I was 
        her and what I would want my own experience to be. It made me visualise the entire 
        experience but putting it on a pdf. It was easier to identify what most people 
        probably experience when they interact with websites and what their pain points 
        are throughout their experience. This was the same with creating the user flow. 
        As I’ve been a user myself on an eCommerce website, I’ve had my own problems 
        interacting with poorly designed sites. It was easier to see where confusion 
        can appear in a user interaction when I started the user flow but it also was 
        easier to see what could make a website more intuitive for a visitor on the website.

    <h3> Week Five 08.08</h3>
    <p>After just watching the CSS grids part 1 coding lecture, 
        it made coding for this course seem a lot more difficult 
        than I thought it would be. Though when I take the quizzes 
        for the coding lectures I know the answers but when I try 
        something shown in the lecture in Visual Studio Code it only 
        works sometimes and doesn't seem to work the other times even 
        though everything I’ve done is the exact same as what was shown in the lecture.

    <h3> Week Six 15.08</h3>
    <p>As we were introduced to assignment 2.1, we looked at colour within web design. 
        The lecture talked about colour which I actually found more intriguing than I 
        thought it would be because I didn’t realise what the different variants were 
        used for (RGB, CMYK, Pantone). When I went to create a colour palette on coolors,
        I found a palette that I wanted to use, but having just started a style guide 
        or the assignment, I found it was too difficult to use multtiple colours
        alongside black and white. Also how accessibility plays a part in web design.
        When I would place coloured text over another colour in my palette, in my mind
        I would think that it looked good and that it was easy to read because I could,
        but in reality, it failed the WebAim contrast checker. This was another reason I 
        found using a colour palette with more colours difficult as opposed to sticking 
        to one primary colour and then the black and white text. However, for my final 
        design, I would like to have a minimalistic design and use as few colours as 
        possible I think will be more successful in doing so.

    <h3> Week Seven 05.09</h3>
    <p>Learning about mental models I thought was a useful 
        diagram to look at for this course because it means 
        you can create interfaces that truly align with a user’s 
        expectations. By understanding how users perceive and interpret
        information, as a designer it means the interfaces become more 
        intuitive and easier to use. But at the same time when designing,
        your website becomes intuitive to you as you’re designing it 
        but probably not to all users. Often, as I've been designing my own
        website and then showing someone else, it didn’t make sense to them but was intuitive to me.

    <h3> Week Eight 12.09</h3>
    <p>Given that I have tried coding before but not CMS, I would like to try
         coding my Radiance skincare website however, because I am not very 
         proficient in coding I would like to also experiment with CMS. I have
          tried both and CMS is a lot easier to recreate my website. Before 
          this assignment, I wasn’t actually aware of what CMS was. I just 
          assumed because I'd never heard of what it was I would use 
          HTML + CSS because I do know what that is and have had some experience 
          with it also the lecture recordings for HTML I thought would be more 
          targeted to specific elements of a website like how to code a Navbar.   
        Watching the  CSS grids part two has me even more confused about how to 
        work with responsiveness on the website. I’ve coded my home page but trying 
        to implement responsiveness into the page makes the website look strange and 
        for this reason, I think I will be switching to CMS.

    <h3> Week Nine 19.09</h3>
    <p>The responsiveness of a website is something I have never really 
        considered until this course. It wasn’t something I paid much 
        attention to. However, actually building a website and seeing
         how bad and unappealing it can be when it's not thought out
          properly definitely makes me more aware of good design in 
          websites. There is no doubt that it would improve user engagement 
          when switching from a computer to a phone or vice versa. I have 
          definitely encountered a website or two where their responsiveness 
          is inadequate and found it difficult to see particular elements. 
          For a user experience, it is frustrating and would result in the
           loss of a potential customer for the business in question.

    <h3> Week Ten 26.09</h3>
    <p>Assignment 2.2 has felt somewhat frustrating. Just because I’ve spent
         a substantial amount of time coding my website, when in fact CMS was 
         very much like Figma. Coding is a skill I would like to develop, however, 
         it has been difficult under time constraints. After spending lots of 
         time coding and then switching to CMS, it took me a total of four hours 
         to complete my EditorX website. Had I done CMS from the beginning, 
         I would have liked to create more pages and links not only because 
         I enjoyed doing it, but to get the website to its full potential 
         as if it were a real eCommerce website.

    <h3> Week Eleven 03.10</h3>
    <p>After all the coding lectures, I am not sure if it is a skill I 
        would ever become proficient in even though I would like to someday.
         It is a very tedious task to complete and when something goes 
         wrong and you have no idea what caused that to happen is a very 
         frustrating position to be in. I did however feel that I learned a 
         lot of basic skills, though I would have to continue coding in order 
         for them to retain in my mind. I think I would be able to build a very
          basic website though it would not be responsive.

    <h3> Week Twelve 10.10</h3>
    <p>This course I thought was very helpful in terms of 
        gaining a better understanding of the way websites 
        are designed. Particularly the reasons why they can be bad, 
        or why they can be good. I continuously catch myself critiquing 
        any website I visit and what could be improved and why a user 
        experience would be positive. I would like to continue to study 
        web design next year, however, it looks like that will not be an option.
        Overall though, I enjoyed the class and what I taught me about web design 
        over the course of its history.
